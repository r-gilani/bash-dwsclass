this is a bash script practice for dwsclass. run this script if it's a valid command.

for try.sh you should pass at least 3 argument. option -i is for Time and -n is for Number of reapeat run command. if your command is valid, exit 0. Otherwise run try.sh for times that you pass in -n option and wait for  x secondes that you pass in -i option.
