this is a bash script practice for dwsclass. run this script if it's a valid command.

for try.sh you should pass at least 3 argument. option -i is for Time and -n is for Number of reapeat run command. if your command is valid, exit 0. Otherwise run try.sh for times that you pass in -n option and wait for  x secondes that you pass in -i option.

fro try2.sh options -i and -n is optional that means you can don't pass them. the app read variables time and number of reapeat from $ENV if not set in $ENV app use defualt value for them.
